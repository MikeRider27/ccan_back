  This endpoint allows searching and filtering for products associated with
  the current hospital. 
  The user's hospital is determined automatically via the JWT token in the
  `Authorization` header.
  Filters are applied based on the product's attributes. All filters are
  optional, and pagination is supported.
  Results are sorted by `code` and then by `id` in ascending order.
